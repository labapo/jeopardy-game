Project Title: 
Jeopardy Coding Game

Motivation: 
This Jeopardy game will be a trivia-like, two player game. This game will have Javascript review questions

Planning: 
Two Classes - Player 
Class for cards? 

Game Specifics-
- Make a grid of 4 categories 5 questions each - goal is to make at least 60 questions. When in testing phase, just use 5 questions to test. Save the 60 questions for the weekend so maybe you can put it in the array or something. 
- Each player will have a turn
- Each player will pick a category and number to answer the question. IF they get it right the scoreboard will update. Stretch, if they get it wrong, the opposing team member will pick the category and score of answer
- When choosing an answer, they will have a multiple choice question
- there will be a timer to answer with the song
- final jeopardy will have 

Controlled by buttons- 
- button to choose category and score amount
- button for the answer choice
- Reset button to reset the whole game and go to 0, and reset the round 

Win State - person with the highest score after 2 rounds and final jeopardy

stretch DOUBLE JEOPARDY

Where I see issues-

- timer and making sure they answer within time (set timeout )
